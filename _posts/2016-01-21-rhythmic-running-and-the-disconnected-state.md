# Rhythmic [Running and the Disconnected State][0]

Rhythmic Running is a new idea. A new way of endurance conditioning where your mind and body are disconnected and yet completely still and aware. You will come to understand in this short 50 page book how to control your thoughts and minimize the pain of distance running by breathing, counting and using the included Rhythmic Running beads as focal points to distract you from the negative perspective your mind has a habit of creating around you.
